Problem :
    Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of
    their digits.

Nota Bene :
    Such numbers are called factorions, and there are exactly four of these
    numbers : http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Factorion.html, but we should exclude
    1 and 2 as they are not sums

Performance time: Trivial
