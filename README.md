## What is Project Euler?

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

## What is this repository?
This repository simply is a way for me to track my own progress through the challenges. If you are undertaking project euler challenges, please refrain from consulting this repository until you have found a solution on your own, both because Project Euler recommends not sharing solutions online and also because you are a responsible human being who loves to tackle challenges and not spoil yourself.

Consider this repository as my permanent personal archive, since posts on the Project Euler forums are not necessarily permanent.

Also, feel free to suggest any code amelioration, be it in terms of style and/or efficiency

## Will there be other languages
Not in the close future. I'm firstly trying to solve the challenges in Python 3. But maybe I'll adapt them into other programming languages when I'm the mood. It will be a good way for me to dig into other programming languages

## About the wiki
For now, it simply is a list of mathematical principles that are expressed by the problems themselves or things I learned that helped me solve a particular problem.

Making a page explaining the logic of the solutions isn't compulsory for the few problems I solved yet, but these may appear in the future.
